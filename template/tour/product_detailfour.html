              <h2>This is a destination detail</h2>
              <p>Umbwe Route; is the most useful, tiniest congested route on mountain trekking. Although, the route is the most challenging route on climbing mountain. Umbwe is a sharp, continuous, straight while climbing to the top.
Umbwe is mostly escaped since the ascent profile doesnâ€™t provide climbers more time to adjust to the altitude (acclimatization). However the success rate is very limited.
Umbwe route takes you six days minimum to reach the peak, though seven days is suggested. The descent is down to Mweka, from the south-east side of the mountain. Umbwe route is not as scenically as Machame, Lemosho and Shira, since the track up and down are close.
Umbwe route is supreme for a climber who wishes a challenges climbing adventure, while more self-confident for their ability to trek over steadily steep slopes. Furthermore, the route is for climbers who more skilled over altitude alteration while confident as the grueling roster of Umbwe route can not impede their capability to regulate upon the altitude. Umbwe route is for those climbers who wish a secluded hike.
This path does not offer the essential phases for acclimatization since the route is of the fast ascent to high altitude. Though the number of crew on this trail is very limited, the probabilities of success are also limited. The route is regarded to be very tough, tiring route - one of which only the strong hikers are recommended due to their ability to acclimatize fast as much as possible.
When getting from the south, the routes use to be short, sharp and straight climbing. After getting at Barranco Camp, the path turns east and traverses beneath Kilimanjaro's Southern Ice Field on a track known as the Southern Circuit before summiting from Barafu. Descent is made via the Mweka route.
